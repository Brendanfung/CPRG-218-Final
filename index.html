    <!--Bio-->
    <div id="bio">
        <p>Hi, I'm <b>Brendan Fung</b>, a junior designer based in Calgary, Alberta. I specialize in creating unique and
            memorable visual media content that stands out. My work spans a variety of disciplines, including web
            design, video production, and graphic design. I always aim to bring fresh ideas and thoughtful
            execution to every project.
            I'm currently completing my <b>Graphic Design Diploma</b> at the <b>Southern Alberta Institute of Technology
                (SAIT)</b>, where I’ve gained a solid foundation in graphic, web, and UX/UI design. This program has
            deepened my understanding of how design can combine form and function to create seamless, user-friendly
            experiences.
            I’ve had the tremendous opportunity to work on a wide range of commissioned projects—each one allowing
            me to explore different aspects of design and expand my creative skillset. I always focus on delivering
            high-quality results that
            make an impact.
            At the core of my approach is the belief that design should be more than just visually appealing—it should
            serve a purpose. Whether it's enhancing the user experience, telling a compelling story, or bringing a
            brand’s vision to life, I strive to create designs that are both beautiful and functional. I’m always
            looking for new challenges and opportunities to push my creativity and continue growing as a designer. Find
            my <b>contact info below.</b>
